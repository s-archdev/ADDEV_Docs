Foreword: The Illusory Balance and the False Equivalency Fallacy
One of the most striking elements of Donald Trump’s ascendancy is how the media, in attempting to appear impartial or balanced, effectively normalized an authoritarian figure. This seeming paradox arises from what philosophers and media critics call “false equivalency”—a logical fallacy wherein two sides of a debate are presented as equally valid, even when one side is demonstrably more extreme or dangerous.
Under this veil of balance, mainstream outlets offered weak or superficial critiques of Trump. Rather than decisively confronting his authoritarian signals—such as attacks on democratic institutions, flagrant bigotry, and open disdain for accountability—many reporters and commentators resorted to mild rebukes or easily dismissible condemnations. The result was an illusion of objectivity that inadvertently strengthened Trump’s position. By placing his candidacy or presidency on the same plane as routine political disagreements, journalists granted him a legitimacy he would otherwise have lacked.
Moreover, an ironic synergy emerged: Fox News openly glorified Trump, while so‐called liberal or centrist networks critiqued him softly or fixated on tangential controversies (e.g., age gaffes, poll numbers) rather than exposing the systemic gravity of his actions. In doing so, these media organizations engaged in a tacit whitewashing of Trump’s authoritarianism—implicitly telling the public that, despite his rhetoric, he was “just another politician” subject to ordinary political checks and balances.
This subtle interplay between tepid critiques and overly generous coverage exemplifies how false equivalency derails public understanding, lulling audiences into seeing a distorted equilibrium. When both “sides” feed into a spectacle for profit, ratings, or perceived neutrality, authoritarian actors like Trump are free to exploit the resulting confusion—and democracy pays the price. - Solarc

Abstract
Donald J. Trump’s rise to power was not a historical anomaly—it was the direct result of media complicity in manufacturing his legitimacy, platforming his rhetoric, and normalizing his brand of authoritarian populism. From Fox News’ overt right-wing propaganda to the centrist media’s false equivalencies and profit-driven sensationalism, major media outlets played a defining role in legitimizing Trump’s candidacy and protecting his administration from the scrutiny it deserved.
This paper argues that:
The mainstream media’s failure to confront Trump’s early authoritarian tendencies allowed him to be treated as a viable candidate.
Fox News and the Murdoch Empire actively sanitized, endorsed, and protected Trump, while also functioning as his personal state-run media apparatus.
Mainstream and centrist media (CNN, NPR, The New York Times, etc.) created false equivalencies between Trump’s authoritarianism and routine Democratic governance, fueling public cynicism and distrust.
Even liberal outlets failed in their responsibility, often focusing on sensationalized scandals rather than systemic corruption.
The ageist framing of Joe Biden and the refusal to apply equal scrutiny to Trump’s cognitive and ethical failures exemplifies this bias.
The paper concludes that mainstream media institutions must be held accountable for their role in Trump’s rise and that a serious reform in media ethics, editorial accountability, and political journalism is required to prevent the further erosion of democracy.

The Media's Role in Manufacturing Trump's Legitimacy
1. Introduction: How the Media Became Trump's Greatest Asset
The election of Donald Trump in 2016 was not the result of an organic populist uprising, but rather a consequence of deliberate media malpractice that gave Trump an unprecedented advantage in exposure, narrative control, and public perception.
This paper examines three primary failures of the media that enabled Trump’s ascent:
The platforming of his extremist rhetoric under the guise of ratings-driven sensationalism.
The false equivalency fallacy that allowed Trump’s corruption to be compared to routine political missteps by Democrats.
The abdication of investigative journalism in favor of access journalism, allowing Trump to control his own narrative unchallenged.
The paper further analyzes how, even in post-Trump years, mainstream media continues to soften Trump’s image while applying harsher scrutiny to Democratic politicians, particularly President Joe Biden.

2. Fox News and the Murdoch Empire: Trump’s State Propaganda Machine
2.1 The Fox-Trump Symbiosis
Fox News did not merely support Trump—it created him. Long before his presidency, Fox provided Trump with a direct line to conservative voters, amplifying his birther conspiracy theories, legitimizing his false economic claims, and portraying him as an "outsider" rather than a wealthy elite.
In 2011, Trump cemented his political brand through a weekly segment on Fox & Friends, using it to spread the birther conspiracy against Obama.
By 2015, Fox provided hours of free, uncritical coverage of his rallies, giving him billions in earned media.
By 2016, Fox fully merged with Trump’s campaign, attacking his critics while ignoring his blatant conflicts of interest.
Fox did not just endorse Trump—it structured its entire editorial mission around his defense.
2.2 The Role of Rupert Murdoch and Corporate Interests
Rupert Murdoch’s media empire prioritized Trump’s success for both ideological and financial reasons. Murdoch, who has a history of shaping right-wing populist movements in the UK and Australia, recognized Trump as a vehicle for deregulation, tax cuts, and right-wing nationalism.
Even when Trump’s relationship with Fox became strained, Murdoch’s empire never withdrew support, instead pivoting strategy:
When Trump attacked Fox, Murdoch expanded coverage on far-right platforms like Newsmax and OANN to keep his base engaged.
Fox maintained its constant undermining of democratic institutions, embracing election denialism and January 6th insurrectionist rhetoric.
Internal documents reveal that Fox knew Trump’s claims were false but spread them anyway to maintain ratings and advertiser revenue. (source: Dominion lawsuit against Fox News, 2023)
Fox was not just a media network—it was an active participant in Trump’s campaign and administration, manufacturing consent for policies that eroded democracy.

3. Mainstream and Centrist Media: The Failure of “Balance” Journalism
3.1 The False Equivalency Problem: Normalizing Authoritarianism
While Fox News acted as Trump’s propaganda machine, mainstream media (CNN, NPR, The New York Times, etc.) enabled Trump’s rise through a misguided commitment to "both sides" journalism.
Rather than recognizing Trump’s clear authoritarian tendencies, major outlets treated his actions as comparable to routine partisanship.
Examples:
Hillary Clinton’s emails were framed as a scandal equivalent to Trump’s corruption, despite no legal wrongdoing. (source: NYT’s excessive email coverage vs. Trump scandals)
Trump’s mocking of disabled people, open racism, and sexual assault allegations were downplayed as “controversies” rather than disqualifications.
Journalists framed his fascist rhetoric as “economic populism,” refusing to confront the reality of his white nationalist appeal.
This false balance legitimized Trump’s extremism while subjecting his opponents to harsher scrutiny for minor offenses.
3.2 How NPR and The New York Times Softened Trump’s Image While Attacking Biden
Even self-described centrist and liberal outlets failed in their duty to confront Trump’s rise.
NPR focused disproportionately on Biden’s age and gaffes, while treating Trump’s cognitive decline and verbal incoherence as entertainment.
The New York Times ran multiple front-page stories about Biden’s age but minimized coverage of Trump’s corruption trials.
Major outlets failed to challenge Trump’s post-presidency power consolidation, instead treating him as a "reformed" figure.
This disparity in coverage fuels public cynicism, voter apathy, and the normalization of far-right governance.
4. The Media’s Post-Presidency Whitewashing of Trump
After Trump’s presidency, the mainstream media had an opportunity to correct its errors by critically evaluating his tenure, holding him accountable for democratic erosion, and ensuring the public understood the gravity of his corruption and criminality. Instead, the media pivoted to a whitewashing strategy, allowing Trump to rebrand himself while shifting harsher scrutiny onto President Joe Biden and Democratic leadership.
4.1 The Softening of Trump’s Image Post-2020
Following the January 6th insurrection and Trump’s second impeachment, many expected that mainstream media would permanently disqualify him from serious political consideration. Instead, the opposite occurred:
Coverage of Trump declined significantly, allowing his narratives to flourish unchallenged in right-wing media.
Major news outlets began describing Trump’s administration as "populist" rather than authoritarian, subtly rehabilitating his image.
Political analysts suggested he had "moderated" or "learned from his mistakes," despite him continuing to promote election fraud conspiracies.
The New York Times even published a post-presidency profile attempting to humanize Trump, painting him as a “misunderstood and lonely figure” rather than a dangerous demagogue. (source)
4.2 Trump’s Criminality Treated as Just Another Political Story
Trump became the first president in U.S. history to be criminally indicted, yet the media downplayed the severity of his legal battles:
Coverage framed Trump’s indictments as political theater rather than an unprecedented challenge to the rule of law.
Networks like CNN and NPR continued to platform Trump allies who defended him under the guise of "balanced coverage."
Reporters often avoided calling Trump’s crimes “crimes”, instead using softened phrases like "alleged misconduct" or "legal troubles."
Compare this with how Hillary Clinton’s email controversy was treated in 2016, where far more damaging headlines and investigative pieces were produced for a scandal with zero criminal indictments.
The result? Trump was given space to spin his criminality as a "witch hunt," further solidifying his base’s loyalty.

5. The Media’s Continued Role in Sustaining Trumpism
Even after leaving office, Trumpism continued to thrive because the media refused to reckon with its own role in enabling it. Instead of aggressively investigating Trump’s legacy, the media pivoted to “both sides” journalism, shifting scrutiny disproportionately onto Biden and the Democratic Party.
5.1 The Ageist Coverage of Joe Biden vs. Trump’s Cognitive Decline
One of the clearest examples of media bias post-2020 is the stark contrast in coverage of Joe Biden’s age versus Donald Trump’s cognitive state.
Disproportionate Focus on Biden’s Age
From 2021 onward, media outlets began aggressively questioning whether Biden was "too old to serve."
NPR, The New York Times, and CNN ran dozens of features on Biden’s gaffes, physical health, and mental fitness.
The framing often suggested that Biden’s minor verbal missteps were proof of unfitness for office.
Ignoring Trump’s Cognitive and Psychological Decline
Meanwhile, Trump’s severe cognitive lapses, slurred speech, and erratic behavior were ignored or excused as “Trump being Trump.”
Despite video evidence of Trump confusing world leaders, forgetting policies, and speaking incoherently, major networks rarely questioned his mental state.
Trump’s bizarre statements—including claiming he won an election he lost and suggesting immigrants are "poisoning the blood" of America—were treated as political talking points rather than evidence of cognitive decline.
This imbalance created a manufactured crisis about Biden’s health while Trump’s own alarming mental deterioration was treated as a non-issue.
5.2 The Myth of the “Trump Voter Makeover”
Another glaring issue in post-2020 media coverage was the insistence on painting Trump voters as misunderstood working-class Americans, rather than radicalized supporters of a proto-fascist movement.
Major networks routinely profiled “Trump voters” in diners, interviewing them as though they represented the average American voter.
The media overlooked the role of racial resentment, white nationalism, and conspiracy radicalization in Trump’s base.
There was a conscious effort to present Trumpism as a "populist revolt" rather than a right-wing authoritarian movement.
This framing validated the grievances of Trump supporters while ignoring the real threat they posed to democracy.

6. Holding the Media Accountable: The Need for Structural Reform
To prevent a repeat of the media’s failure in the Trump era, serious structural changes must be implemented in journalism.
6.1 Rejection of False Equivalency Journalism
Media institutions must abandon "both sides" reporting when one side is engaging in authoritarianism.
Treating Trump’s threats to democracy as a legitimate political stance is both dangerous and misleading.
Coverage should prioritize factual accountability over false neutrality.
6.2 Eliminating Profit-Driven Sensationalism
The media’s financial incentives—clicks, ratings, and ad revenue—should not dictate coverage.
Networks should refuse to provide free airtime to known disinformation peddlers (e.g., Trump surrogates promoting the Big Lie).
Investigative journalism must be prioritized over horse-race election coverage.
6.3 Demanding Transparency in Editorial Decision-Making
Media organizations must publicly acknowledge editorial biases and take accountability for misleading narratives.
Retractions and corrections should be given as much prominence as initial errors.
6.4 Holding Right-Wing Propaganda Networks Accountable
Fox News and the Murdoch empire should be recognized as a political propaganda machine, not a journalistic entity.
Laws should address corporate consolidation of media to prevent single entities from controlling the national narrative.
The public must demand that news organizations adhere to ethical journalism standards rather than serving as political operatives.

7. Conclusion: Media Malpractice and the Future of Democracy
The media’s failure to challenge Trump’s rise, its continued protection of him post-presidency, and its disproportionate scrutiny of his political opponents all contributed to the endurance of Trumpism in American politics.
Without systemic media reform, the same cycle of normalization and false equivalencies will enable future authoritarian figures to rise unchecked.
Final Call to Action
Journalists must take a stand against both sides-ism when democracy is at stake.
Media consumers must demand accountability from news organizations.
Corporate consolidation of news must be challenged to ensure media independence.
If these steps are not taken, the next Trump-like figure will not just rise again—he will succeed where Trump failed.
